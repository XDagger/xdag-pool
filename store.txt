    get miners hashrate rank from last set.

share exist : whether a share had been submitted before, util/share.go
    two sets(map with empty struct value). switch every 15 minutes. reserve current set as last set, make a new current set.
    key: miner's address+share params, stored when valid share found(miner.go: processShare->WriteBlock) .
